# Example Posts Directory

Place your example LinkedIn posts here as `.txt` or `.md` files.

## Instructions

1. Copy 10-30 of your previous LinkedIn posts into this directory
2. Save each post as a separate file (e.g., `post1.txt`, `post2.md`, etc.)
3. Include only the post content, not comments or metadata
4. The more examples you provide, the better the style analysis will be

## Example

Create a file `post1.txt`:
```
Just finished an incredible project with my team. Here's what I learned:

1. Clear communication beats technical brilliance
2. Small wins compound into big results
3. The best solutions are often the simplest

What's your biggest takeaway from your recent projects?
```

## Next Steps

After adding your examples, run:
```bash
python scripts/analyze_style.py
```

This will analyze your writing style and create a style guide.
